# ChessBoard
I am building a automated chess board that moves pieces by itself through voice commands
running on raspberry pi 3 and adafruit stepper motor hat with nema 17 stepper motors

There are a lot of commits because I push to github then pull it over ssh on the raspberry pi.
## Automated Chess Board Controlled
* uses stepper motors to control x and y axis and an electromagnet to move pieces
* google voice api to use voice control
* [motor set up](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi/powering-motors)
* [possible chess program for playing against cpu](https://code-projects.org/simple-chess-game-in-python-with-source-code/)
