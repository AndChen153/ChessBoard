## Automated Chess Board Controlled
* uses stepper motors to control x and y axis and an electromagnet to move pieces
* There are a lot of commits because I push to github then pull it over ssh on the raspberry pi.
* google voice api to use voice control
* [motor set up (old version)](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-dc-and-stepper-motor-hat-for-raspberry-pi/powering-motors)
* Switched to [Pololu DRV8825 Stepper motor controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUbhPKBL_IU&t=1412s&ab_channel=rdagger68)
* [possible chess program for playing against cpu](https://code-projects.org/simple-chess-game-in-python-with-source-code/)
